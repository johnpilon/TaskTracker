# Documentation Integrity Rule

This project contains living engineering documents that act as guardrails.
They must reflect **what exists now**, not plans, aspirations, or inferred improvements.

## Hard Rules

- Documentation updates must be **factual and past-tense only**.
- Do NOT rewrite, restructure, or “improve” documents unless explicitly instructed.
- Do NOT add new philosophy, future plans, or speculative ideas.
- Do NOT convert implemented work back into “planned” language.
- Do NOT duplicate sections that already exist.

## Planned vs Implemented

- If a feature/component has been implemented, it must be documented as **implemented**.
- If a section describes a feature as “planned” but it already exists, the section must be corrected or marked obsolete.
- Never leave contradictory “planned” and “implemented” descriptions in the same document.

## Allowed Changes Without Explicit Permission

You MAY:
- Add a clearly labeled **Current State** or **Post-Change** section describing completed work.
- Update wording to reflect that a planned item has been completed.
- Add small factual deltas after a refactor or extraction.

You may NOT:
- Rephrase existing sections for clarity.
- Expand scope.
- Introduce new concepts.
- Change section ordering or hierarchy.

## Style Constraints

- Preserve existing Markdown structure and heading levels.
- Use concise bullet points.
- Prefer accuracy over completeness.
- When unsure, ask instead of guessing.

## Priority

If there is a conflict between:
- Existing documentation
- Inferred intent
- Code reality

**Code reality wins**, and documentation must be updated to match it.
